# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Tasks

We will be marking on your ability to spot bad code and refactoring it into a more efficient solution.

The solution should allow the user to select an alert with the dropdown and should only display one alert at a time.

1. Fix any bugs you find
2. Add a third Alert called 'error'
3. Add PropTypes
4. Refactor the code
5. Extra points for converting the App class to Hooks
